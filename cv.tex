%	PROFILE SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%\section{profile}
%\hspace{0.75cm} Highly analytical, extremely versatile and educated to PhD level, I am a strong independent learner with a determined attitude and experience of leading projects to success. Resilient and accustomed to overcoming challenges through problem-solving and collaboration, I bring a track record of working innovatively to tease out meaning from complex datasets and deliver findings to stakeholders through professional reports and clear presentations.

%\hspace{0.75cm} As an \textbf{investigator}, I use my creativity and logic to design experiments and plan workflows which generate data using cutting-edge technologies. As an \textbf{analyst}, I use sophisticated methods to analyse a variety of datasets with bespoke scripts and pipelines tailored to individual problems. As a \textbf{project manager}, I have experience of funding applications, budgets, staff supervision and development, and building networks.

{%
%\begin{itemize}
%\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
\textbf{Innovation:} supported projects across Research, Data \& Analytics and Standards teams by bringing innovations and delivering bespoke solutions, e.g. development of a QR code based mark-tracking system. \\
\textbf{Reproducible analytical pipelines:} developed a suite of internal R packages for cleaning, quality-checking, and analysis of Official Statistics and exam grading datasets, including functions \& unit tests, documentation \& vignettes. \\
\textbf{Data engineering:} wrote R pipelines to join raw datasets and engineer features to support regulation of standards in assessment. \\
\textbf{Interactive applications:} routinely produced interactive R Shiny apps: 4 published apps, 20 internal, 1 private external. Transformed analysis of consultations through use of bespoke internal apps enabling more than 30 users to make informed decisions under pressure. \\
\textbf{Data visualisation:} wrote R package to implement company brand and style in data visualisations. Includes vignettes packed with examples \& best practise.%

{2013--2019}
{Research Scientist}
{UCL \& ZSL Institute of Zoology}
{Investigated the spread and evolution of viruses using genomics, laboratory experiments and field studies. Collaborated with 19 research groups in 16 countries. \\
\textbf{Problem-solving:} iterative experimental design, logistics/planning of field-based projects. \\
\textbf{Data analysis:} from genomics to GIS and citizen science datasets. Routinely used statistical models (LM, GLM, GAM, mixed-effects). Also used machine learning approaches. As a supervisor, collaborator \& peer reviewer, I reviewed data summaries and identified patterns in raw data requiring further investigation. \\
